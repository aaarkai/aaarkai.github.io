正值端午假期，有点感冒发烧，没有出门计划。

整理维护了一下 Beancount 记账的脚本，添加了从 API fetch 基金价格的功能，方便后续做资产配置。

重新制作上线了自己的 github page 页面，来发布文章和近况。

最近在读的书：The Seven Stages of Money Maturity

2024年6月9日，更新于上海家中。

During the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, I caught a cold and have a fever, so I have no plans to go out.

I organized and maintained my Beancount accounting scripts and added a feature to fetch fund prices from an API, which will facilitate future asset allocation.

I recreated and launched my GitHub page to publish articles and updates.

The book I am currently reading: "The Seven Stages of Money Maturity."
