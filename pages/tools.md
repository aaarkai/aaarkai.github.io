Here are some tools and resources that might be useful.

I use Apple Notes and [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) for my note-taking needs. In most situations, Apple Notes and Reminders are sufficient to quickly capture my ideas. I use Logseq primarily for writing long-form articles. Additionally, I've developed some Apple Shortcuts powered by ChatGPT or Azure OpenAI API to:
  - Convert voice recordings into text notes.
  - Summarize my notes and generate to-do lists.
  - Provide thought-provoking questions and advice.

For coding, I rely on [Zed](https://zed.dev/). Zed is fast, simple, and powerful, effectively replacing VSCode in my workflow.

In financial management, I choose [Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/) as my ledger application. My priorities are maintaining financial privacy and leveraging powerful features. I've developed scripts to import bills from WeChat/Alipay in China and to record my investments and assets. For those pursuing Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE), understanding your financial situation is always the first step. Knowing your financial status enables you to make informed decisions about your life.

Finally, ChatGPT or any other large language model (LLM) service is indispensable. If you can prompt or code, LLMs can significantly enhance productivity. For example, I frequently use ChatGPT to simulate conversations to practice my English, evaluate my responses, and provide feedback. Furthermore, you can tokenize an entire book to generate a GPT agent, effectively gaining access to a legendary mentor for just $20 a month.
