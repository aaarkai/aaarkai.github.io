    <title>Shower-curtain effect</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<br />
<div><p>Moved into a new home, I noticed the shower curtain always gets
sucked onto my body while showering, which is quite annoying.</p>
<p>After some research, I found that this phenomenon, known as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower-curtain_effect">Shower
Curtain Effect</a>, has been studied before. Although thereâ€™s no
definitive conclusion, a few plausible explanations exist:</p>
<p><strong>Buoyancy Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p>When showering, hot water heats the air, causing it to rise. Cooler
air near the floor then gets pushed in from under the curtain to replace
the rising air. This hypothesis seems plausible since the phenomenon is
often more noticeable when taking hot showers on cold days.</p>
<p><strong>Bernoulli Effect Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p>An increase in speed leads to a decrease in pressure. The water
flowing from the shower head causes the surrounding air to flow in the
same direction, parallel to the shower curtain. This parallel movement
reduces the air pressure inside the curtain, creating a pressure
difference between the inside and outside, causing the curtain to move
inward.</p>
<p>The solution is simple: use hooks to secure the bottom of the curtain
or weigh it down.</p></div>
